            <h2 style="color: #128f8f;">Club Career</h2>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo began his professional career at Sporting Lisbon before moving to Manchester United, where he won three Premier League titles and his first Ballon d'Or. He then transferred to Real Madrid, becoming the club's all-time leading scorer and winning four Champions League titles. After a successful stint at Juventus, he returned to Manchester United for a second spell. Ronaldo has also excelled on the international stage, leading Portugal to victory in the 2016 UEFA European Championship and the 2019 UEFA Nations League. Known for his remarkable goal-scoring ability and work ethic, he remains one of the greatest footballers of all time.

            <h2 style="color: #128f8f;">Playing style</h2>
            <p>Ronaldo is able to play on both wings and also as a striker since he is very strong with both feet, even though he is naturally right footed. He is also one of the world fastest players.

                He has good heading ability because he is over 6 feet tall and jumps high. He is also known for his free kicks; he likes to use the "knuckleball" technique, which is where the ball spins very little and creates an unpredictable motion.
                
                He combines this with his high shot power, making it hard for goalkeepers to stop his shots. Ronaldo combines exceptional speed, strength, and agility, making him a formidable presence in attack. His ability to outpace defenders is a hallmark of his game.
                Ronaldo’s intense training regimen and commitment to fitness have allowed him to maintain peak performance levels, even into his late 30s. His dedication to improving his skills is evident in his work on shooting, positioning, and set-pieces.
